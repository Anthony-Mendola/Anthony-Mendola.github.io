<p>Hi! I'm Anthony and I'm currently enrolled in the Flat Iron School Web Developer Bootcamp. I decided to change my career from being an accountant to pursue my passion of computer science. I've always loved computers, my first experience was on my Uncle's  MS-DOS when I was 5 years old. I am naturally curious and wanted to know how they worked eventually taking them apart and building my own. As an auditor in a public accounting firm, I was not able to build things or be creative although I loved solving problems and finding solutions.  Once I started coding I realized it combined all the things I loved and I needed to immerse myself into it!</p>
