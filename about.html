<p>Hi! I'm Anthony and I'm currently enrolled in the Flatiron School Web Developer Bootcamp. I decided to change my career from being an accountant to pursue my passion for computer science. I've always loved computers, my first experience was on my uncle's  MS-DOS when I was 5 years old. I'm naturally curious and wanted to know how they worked, eventually taking them apart and building my own. As an auditor in a public accounting firm, one of my main skills was problem-solving.  It wasn't until I started working at a tech start-up that I realized I could actually create solutions for these real-world problems. Once I started coding I was hooked, it combined all the things I loved and I immersed myself in it!</p>
