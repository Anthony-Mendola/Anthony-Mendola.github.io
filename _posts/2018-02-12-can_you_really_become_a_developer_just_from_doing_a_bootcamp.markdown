**The short answer is yes you can!** From speaking to graduates who attended a reputable bootcamp, as well as looking at audited job reports, within 60 days of graduating, most who complete a proper job-search cycle find a job.

**The long answer.** Being a developer/programmer is a career of never ending learning. With that in mind, companies are constantly growing and expanding as new technologies become available. They actually would want someone who is motivated and capable of learning difficult topics in a short amount of time. With that said, you need to know how to code! Do you understand the fundamentals? Are you able to solve-problems, work independently, or collaborate on teams? All this needs to be articulated on your interview. 

**I thought I needed a Computer Science degree?** Although having a CS degree would obviously help and not hurt, it isn't neccessary. Attending a great bootcamp like Flatiron School will teach you the computer science skills that you need to build a solid foundation for learning. Most with a CS degree who want to be programmers actually are self-taught or also need to attend bootcamps. 

**Put in the time.** A 15 week in-person bootcamp may seem like a short amount of time but this can easily equate to over 1000 hours of learning and projects averaging around 10 hours per day. To put this into perspective, most people work 40 hours per week, without taking into account holidays and vacation time, they average 2000 working hours per year! Bootcamp graduates are doing more than half that in 15 weeks....employers give them a huge amount of credit. Online bootcamps are no different, specifically Flatiron which I have first hand experience with. In addition to over 1000 hours of course work and projects, I'd guesstimate there's another 2000 hours worth of instructional videos, study groups, and 1:1 help. The benefit of being online is that you aren't forced to move on to the next topic if you need more time to understand it and can learn topics much more indepth.
