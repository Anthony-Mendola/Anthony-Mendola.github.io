*1. I don't know where to start*

Just start! This concept is the same as writing an essay back in high school or college. You're looking at a blank word document but once you started, the words would flow. Now with code this might be a bit difficult if you're still a newbie. Start with pseudo-code, what do you want your program to do? What functionality do you want it to have? Then slowly convert your pseudo-code into the language you're most comfortable with.


*2. Break it down!*

If you're getting bugs and failing tests, break down your code line by line. What is each line doing? Some languages are so finicky. Look at syntax, spelling, and punctuation. Have you checked every period, semi-colon, bracket, paranthesis, and quotation? 


*3. Still stuck after doing the above?*

Time to call in the "Rubber Duckie"! Rubber Duckie Debugging is a practice still done by the most experienced programmers. They explain their code out loud to a rubber duckie or their favorite inanimate object. This concept, although it may sound strange or simple to most, is actually backed by science. Reading out loud allows you to access more brain power to find and fix mistakes.


*4. Your trusty friend, Google *

There is a very high chance that someone else has encountered the same issue that has you stuck. Give the good ol'Google a search of a snippet of your code and see what comes up. You may find the exact answer you're looking for or at the very least, a similar situation that you can adapt your code to. Jumping on YouTube wouldn't hurt either, tons of excellent tutorials on there. There's also great Facebook and Slack groups with an amazing community of people who are always willing to help.


Most importantly don't give up. If you're getting frustrated, go take a walk, meditate, go to the gym. Do something else and get back to it with a clear mind.
