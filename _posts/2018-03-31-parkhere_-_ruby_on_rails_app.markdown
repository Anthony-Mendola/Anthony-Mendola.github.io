Completing my rails app was probably one of the most rewarding experiences I've had thus far. Having an idea and seeing it manifest before your eyes is a great feeling. 

The vision for this application started through the daily NYC struggle of finding a parking spot. Wouldn't it be great to always have a parking spot at the locations you most frequently visit, especially home? I noticed many homeowners in my neighborhood had driveways and garages that they would never use. They could rent these spots to make side income while helping reduce frustration for those who have trouble finding parking. The application allows users to sign-up and  create a listing for their available parking space. Anyone can view that listing and contact the listing owner if they choose. The listing has detailed information under a specific user created category. Users are able to also leave reviews under each listing. Another important feature was the ability to add a user submittable field of length of vehicle. Cars come in all sizes and my not fit in all spots so I thought this was a must-have. My end goal is to implement more features to create the AirBnB of parking. 

I learned and perfected a lot of new skills during this project. I passionately love the Ruby language and the Rails framework, they are so intuitive and feel like natural language. I used multiple gems which included Devise and OmniAuth for user functions like signing up and logging in. Adding the Google Maps API was a fun experience. Having a mapped out location not only looks great but helps people find exactly what they are looking for. These days when creating an account, the ease of being able to login with Facebook is a huge plus, I added that feature using the OmniAuth gem and Facebook developer tools.
