Building this app was an amazing experience. Combining everything i've learned so far into this beautiful creation gave me the strongest sense of accomplishment. I love learning by doing because it's genuinely fun. I always say, it's all about enjoying the journey!

It didn't take too much brainstorming to come up with the idea for this app. I really wanted to build something that would tie together another one of my passions, quantum physics, and coding. I was inspired after reading about experiments by Dr. Masuru Emoto. In his experiments he exposes water to words (voice or written) or feelings (prayer or visualizations) and then looks at them under a microscope to see how they've changed. For example, when he says the word "appreciation" next to the water, it changes from a normal molecule to a beautiful molecule resembling a snowflake. When exposed to words like "hate", the molecules become ugly and distorted. Now imagine our bodies are made of more than 60% of water, doesn't it make sense that we can actually change our bodies to promote things like wellness through feelings of appreciation? The iAppreciate app allows you to record moments of appreciation so that you can come back to them at anytime to get back into that feeling of appreciation, thus changing the chemistry of your body. 

My web application was built using the Sinatra framework. I started out creating the structure of my project dividing it into models, views, and controllers, known as MVC Structure. The best analogy that helped me understand this concept is relating it to a restaurant.  The chef who is cooking is my model where most of my code is. The waiter is my controller who gets your order and then serves it to you which is the handling of HTTP requests. The view is the delicious food that arrives to your table which is my html pages. Once I had this set up I started coding it all out and connect it to my database using ActiveRecord. 

One of the best tools I used was a gem called Shotgun which allowed me to run the app and code in real-time. I'd constantly code a line and refresh my app to ensure I wasn't breaking anything or getting errors. I spent a lot of time on getting the functionality exactly the way I wanted it. I didn't take any shortcuts. For example, I created an entire page with additonal controller actions just to confirm that you're deleting something that you really want to delete. I really put myself in the shoes of the user to ensure it had all the features that someone would really find useful. 

I also wanted it to look visually appealing so I loaded a bootstrap template to help me save time but still have it look awesome. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy using my app!
