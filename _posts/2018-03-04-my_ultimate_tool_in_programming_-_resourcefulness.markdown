As a developer, one of our main goals is to solve problems. There are tons of tools to help us do that quickly and more efficiently than ever before. When you are unable to solve a problem, you may think you have a logical excuse that you didn't have the right resources, like the technology, money, time, or experience.  These resources are extremely easy to get when you're working for a big company like Google or Facebook. They are equipped with an arsenal of the best tools and minds to get almost any job done. 

But why is it that some of the most successful applications are built by a startup or someone in their basement? They didn't have the same resources as these tech giants that they were up against, so how did they do it? When you look at the most powerful and effective people in history, resources were never the problem. It's because they were resourceful. As Tony Robbin's says, the ultimate resources aren't things or people, but they are emotional states like creativity, decisiveness, and passion. When you engage these resources, you can get any other resource on Earth. 

How to be resourceful? Stop making excuses. Resourcefulness allows you to commit yourself with no other option but to succeed. Burn your boats and take the island. You are in charge of your own success. Most of us give ourselves a way out which is why we don't achieve our dreams and goals. When you think you've tried everything, you've actually tried everything except the thing that works. 80% of success at anything is psychology and 20% is mechanics.  If you're creative enough can you find the solution? Of course. If you're determined enough....If you're committed enough.....You can do anything, you can find the money, the time, the person, or whatever it is that you need to achieve your goals.
