I thought it would be a fun exercise to write down the candidate qualities that an employer, who I'd want to hire me, is looking for. It's usually the inverse, we try to find job descriptions that match us, but in this case, I'm putting out my "ad" for employers to find me :)

The following are qualities/skills within me that I value, if you're an employer, this would be written in your "Who we are looking for?" section of your job posting.

* Get things done attitude, point me in the general direction of a problem and consider it handled quickly without compromising quality

* Focused on open communication to both my team and company working collaboratively or independently 

*  Resourcefulness, taking responsibility on a task no matter how scary it is and seeing it through using whatever resources I have or find a way to get them

* Confident in many frontend/backend programming languages/frameworks (JavaScript, Ruby/Rails, React, Python)

* Having a full stack holistic view that helps with seeing things not only from a development perspective but also the financial/business/client side

* Empathy, genuinely caring about my co-workers and clients. Being able to see a situation from someone else's eyes

* Problem-solving mind, always wanting to make things better, building maintainable, efficient, clean code

* Willingness to deeply understand a problem and absorb as much context as possible, allowing me to provide tremendous value to my team and customers/clients

* Being a positive influence to those around me and enjoy having fun with my  work and co-workers

* Consistent drive for learning and growth. Not only becoming the best engineer but also the best version of myself

* Adaptability to work with different types of teams and project methodologies

* Love to teach and learn from my peers

* Strong curiosity to stay up to date in the industry knowing the latest cutting-edge technologies

* Realize that it's okay to fail and make a mistake as we are all human but know to fail fast, learn from them and fix them

* Creating features & results and knowing how to choose the best technology for the goal at hand

* Truly passionate about software engineering and love using those skills to create and make an impact on the world

* Taking constructive criticism positively because I  want to be the best at my job

* Balanced thinking of edge cases with planning and goal setting for future growth and changes

* Fostering a family-like workplace culture enjoying being with co-workers, going to lunch together or after work functions

* On the same wavelength as the company as a whole and excited for the mission/vision of the company

* Enthusiastic to come to work every single day, even on Mondays!

If you're an employer who values the above, contact me!
