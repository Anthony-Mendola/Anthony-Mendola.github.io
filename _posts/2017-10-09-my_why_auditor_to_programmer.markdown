 I am a big believer in becoming the best version of yourself which requires constant learning. I also believe in following your dreams but what do you do when you haven't figured out what your dreams are yet? In my case, you become an accountant. It paid well, great job security, and I truly enjoyed the language of business.

What do you do when you feel like something is missing? You figure out what that is! As an auditor in a public accounting firm, most of my work came from an investigative problem solving approach. I loved the challenge to find solutions and it was great for a few years. But something was lacking. They say, to figure out your true passion, think back of what you enjoyed doing when you were young. As a child I enjoyed tinkering with computers and building fun websites. That's what was lacking from accounting! I couldn't build anything or use my creativity. Programming encompasses everything I am passionate about: building things, creativity, and problem solving. I love to travel so the ability to work remotely is a big bonus among being a big tech nerd.

Once I started learning coding I knew automatically it was my dream career. I had zero hesitation enrolling in the Flat Iron Bootcamp. Another thing I love about programming is that the learning never ends. That's exactly how I live my life and know this career is the perfect fit. I am looking forward to this amazing journey!
