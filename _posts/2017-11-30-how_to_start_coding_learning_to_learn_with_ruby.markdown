Jump right in. Pick a language and put the knowledge you learn into action as quickly as possible

What language do I recommend? For your first language, Ruby is excellent. It's simple and intuitive. Ruby makes coding enjoyable so that you can focus more on the design of your program rather than the technicalities. 

As a new programmer, it's important to realize that you must change the way you think to learn things you've never learned. Learning how to learn is key to becoming a successful programmer because this teaches us how to recognize universal concepts that exist in every coding language. If you're really excited to learn coding but you're frustrated with learning a difficult language, that will be an unneccessary uphil battle. Learn a lanugage that makes it easy to fall in love with.

 Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto who's main goal was to make programmers happy. It is the only language with that goal. It also gives users unlimited freedom and creativity with endless arrangements of code to achieve the same outcome. This takes into account that we are all different and expresses the importance of individuality. It is the reason so many are passionate about Ruby, it is an art form rather than just a programming language. Many Rubyists begin to think in Ruby because it is so adaptable which allows them to easily transfer their creative thoughts into code. 
 
 There have been so many companies that are now worth billions that used Ruby to create their original application and continue to use it. AirBnB, Shopify, Twitch, & GitHub to name a few.  Isn't it easy to create something innovative when you're happy? Ruby = happiness = creativity = innovation = success. 
 
The most effective way to actually learn something is to put it into practice. It's easy to code along or read coding books, it gives you the false assumption that you're learning. Now I am not putting that down, doing code alongs as well as reading code books are great resources, but you have to know when to put the book down and actually create something. What has helped me is to do a small programming project with every new concept I learn. Seeing your knowledge turn into a creation solidifies that knowledge. Once you're done with all the concepts and small projects, it is time to apply all into a more intricate app that displays your skills. Taking action by applying knowledge gives you experience and there is no substitute for experience. 

Happy coding! :)
