### What are Actions and why is this a big deal?


Actions allow developers to not only host their code but also run it. For example, they can set a certain Github event like a push to trigger an action that will then do something else. Let's say you want Twilio to send you a text message everytime their's a "urgent issue" tag in your repository. You can now run your code within Github and turn it into an Action that sets off certain steps.

This is a big deal because it's one of the biggest changes Github has ever made. It will allow developers to completely automate their workflows, whether that is sending notifications or building a full continuous integration and delivery pipeline. In the words of Github, "Easily build, package, release, update, and deploy your project in any language—on GitHub or any external system—without having to run code yourself".

Eventually Github is toying with the idea to allow developers to sell their workflows and Actions through the Github marketplace. This can be huge for developers who don't want to build an enterprise version of their tools but still want to monetize on their work.
