I frequently check-in on my bootcamp's Slack group and try to help those in need. On a daily basis, I see people struggling with understanding React Redux. I was one of them. It isn't that React or Redux is complicated, I think it was not being able to see it from a high-level that continued the confusion. Once I understood the flow of everything, my entire perception changed and it became easy. 

I hope this diagram helps you!:

I will be posting a follow-up to this blog post to explain the reason we may need Redux in our application.
